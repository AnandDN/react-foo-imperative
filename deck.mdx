# Components as building block
---
# Self Sustained
---
# Communicate

# Top Down Approach
---
# Declrative way of control
---
# 99.99%
---
# Sometimes
---
# Escape Hatch
---
# Instance of component
---
# Lets go through example
---
# Case 1: react-slick
---
# Solution 1: Fork the lib and add the feature
---
# Solution 2: SlickToGo function
---
# Case 2: avoid rerenders
---
# $ + React = Not a good idea
---
# Jqxgrid lib with react wrapper
---
# Demo
---
# Updating grid column
---
# Dont overuse Refs
<img src={overuseRef} width="500px" height="500px" />
---
# this.myRef.current.setState({â€¦})
