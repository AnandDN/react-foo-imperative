# React Components

# Escape Hatch
---
# Summary of how it works
---
# Lets go through example
---
# Case 1: react-slick

---
# Jqxgrid lib with react wrapper
---
# Demo
---
# Updating grid column
---
# Dont overuse Refs
<img src={imageUrl} width="500px" height="500px" />
---
# this.myRef.current.setState({â€¦})
